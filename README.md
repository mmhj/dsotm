# Dark Side of The Moon ðŸŒ‘

This is a colour scheme for [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com) based on [pgaspar's adaptation](https://github.com/pgaspar/base16-eighties-dark) of [tyre's Atom theme](https://github.com/tyre/base16-eighties-dark).

This colour scheme was modified with Python in mind, it focuses on a pastel colour palette with an old school feel.
I use it combined with [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

## Instructions for installation:

### Windows

* Save the [`dsotm.tmTheme`](https://github.com/mmhj/dsotm/blob/main/tmTheme/dsotm.tmTheme) file locally
* Open [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com), and navigate to `Preferences -> Browse Packages`
* Move the `dsotm.tmTheme` file into the `Packages` folder
* Navigate to `Preferences -> Settings -> â€” User` and change the `"color_scheme"` setting to `"color_scheme": "Packages/dsotm.tmTheme",`
* Alternatively, you can also choose to save the [`dsotm.tmTheme`](https://github.com/mmhj/eighties_dsotm/blob/main/tmTheme/dsotm.tmTheme) file in other folders, just remember to update the `"color_scheme": "Packages/dsotm.tmTheme",` setting to reflect the path


### macOS

* Save the [`dsotm.tmTheme`](https://github.com/mmhj/dsotm/blob/main/tmTheme/dsotm.tmTheme) file locally

## Font

I use the [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) font in Sublime Text.
It works really well with this colour scheme, but it works well with anything really.

I won't go into detail for adding or changing fonts on various OS', but if you want to play with the Sublime Text font you can find it here:

* Navigate to `Preferences -> Settings -> â€” User` on Windows, `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings -> â€” User` on macOS, and change the `"font_face"` setting
* For example I changed the setting to `"font_face": "Source Code Pro",`
